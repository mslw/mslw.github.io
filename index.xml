The question may seem trivial, but naming files is an everyday practice with real consequences on data usability that isn&amp;#39;t talked about very often.
When looking for existing recommendations, we found a popular presentation Naming Things by Jenny Bryan, a related presentation Project Structure by Danielle Navarro, and a colelction of File naming best practices from the MIT Libraries.</description></item><item><title>The search for a perfect note taking app</title><link>https://mslw.github.io/posts/2021-11-01-note-taking-apps/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Nov 2021 17:50:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://mslw.github.io/posts/2021-11-01-note-taking-apps/</guid><description>A note taking app is essential: meeting notes, quick how-tos, sketches of ideas call for a simple and convenient tool. While note taking seems like a straightforward task, there is a surprising variety of programs, and it&amp;#39;s difficult to find a perfect one.
So far I&amp;#39;ve had good experiences with Bear, Joplin, and Emacs with Org Mode. However, none of them came close enough to perfection for me to stick with it and forget about others.</description></item><item><title>Combining nilearn plots</title><link>https://mslw.github.io/posts/2021-06-01-combining-nilearn-plots/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jun 2021 23:45:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://mslw.github.io/posts/2021-06-01-combining-nilearn-plots/</guid><description>Visual presentation of brain results should be clear for the viewer, but the exact kind of a plot will depend on the result presented (just a single, super-important cluster? a scattering of voxels? widespread network?). Still, preferences vary, and finding the right way to present a given result may feel almost like finding one&amp;#39;s own artistic voice.
For the last given example (widespread activation of multiple brain regions), I have grown to prefer a montage of slices, accompanied by a glass-brain showing selected cuts.</description></item><item><title>Matlab table &amp; string</title><link>https://mslw.github.io/posts/2021-05-05-matlab-table-string/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mslw.github.io/posts/2021-05-05-matlab-table-string/</guid><description>In this post I am taking a closer look at tables and strings in matlab.
Matlab continuously evolves, and the two data types are fairly recent additions to the language: table was added in R2013b and string in R2016b. Table arrays store tabular data and can make its handling (sorting, filtering, joining etc.) much more convenient than &amp;ldquo;classical&amp;rdquo; cell arrays. In a way, they are similar to dataframes known from R or python / pandas, although more basic.</description></item><item><title>Giving in to pyenv</title><link>https://mslw.github.io/posts/2021-03-19-giving-in-to-pyenv/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mslw.github.io/posts/2021-03-19-giving-in-to-pyenv/</guid><description>There are several ways of installing and managing python on macOS, and in this post I am taking a closer look at pyenv. The write-up is divided into two segments. In the first (which I called &amp;ldquo;life story&amp;rdquo; during writing) I explain why I was avoiding pyenv for a long time and what caused me to give in. The second is technical and provides a short reference for creating and using my current setup.</description></item><item><title>Working with Siemens physio (.puls) files</title><link>https://mslw.github.io/posts/2020-12-17-working-with-siemens-physio/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Dec 2020 16:25:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://mslw.github.io/posts/2020-12-17-working-with-siemens-physio/</guid><description>Siemens Physiological Monitoring Unit uses its own format for data storage. Conveniently, it produces text files with a fairly simple representation, which should be easy to parse. I only worked with pulse oximetry, but similar rules should hold for other physio data. This is a compilation of external sources, own experiences and code snippets.
Toolboxes Before we dig into the files: you may find what you already need in one of the following toolboxes (with which I have no experience), both in Matlab:</description></item><item><title>Docker pruning</title><link>https://mslw.github.io/posts/2020-12-17-docker-pruning/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Dec 2020 14:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://mslw.github.io/posts/2020-12-17-docker-pruning/</guid><description>Sometimes (especially after messing around with several different images) I get the „No space left on device” error when doing even the simplest of tasks (e.g. running a small container or trying to build a new one). This issue may be MacOS-specific. Finding a clear answer wasn’t straightforward, so below I summarise what I learned.
The problem boils down to the Docker’s disk image, located (on MacOS) under:
~/Library/Containers/com.docker.docker/Data/vms/0/Docker.qcow2 See Stackoverflow: What is Docker.</description></item><item><title>Inkscape + ImageMagick: a powerful combination</title><link>https://mslw.github.io/posts/2020-09-28-inkscape-imagemagick/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mslw.github.io/posts/2020-09-28-inkscape-imagemagick/</guid><description>I can&amp;rsquo;t recommend Inkscape enough, either for assembling figures or for building posters. However, Inkscape on its own does not export to tiff. Luckily, this can be accomplished with ImageMagick. Here&amp;rsquo;s a short recipe, and a sort of laudation for both programs.
Recently I had to rework a figure with a schematic of an experimental design. The first version was put together in PowerPoint, but we somehow lost the ungrouped source file, so I had to start from scratch.</description></item><item><title>Now listening: Metallica - S&amp;M2</title><link>https://mslw.github.io/posts/2020-09-02-metallica-sm2/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mslw.github.io/posts/2020-09-02-metallica-sm2/</guid><description>About a week ago, Metallica released the S&amp;amp;M2 album, a recording of their live performance with the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra from September 2019 (and a follow-up on a similar collaboration from twenty years prior, April 1999). In my opinion, the first metal musician was Wagner, so Metallica recording with a symphony orchestra should make perfect sense, yet I was never very fond of the 99 edition. The new one, though, made a huge impression: I was listening to Spotify at work and had to take a short break to focus on the music.</description></item><item><title>Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order game review</title><link>https://mslw.github.io/posts/2020-06-09-jedi-fallen-order/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mslw.github.io/posts/2020-06-09-jedi-fallen-order/</guid><description>Recently, I completed the latest Star Wars game. I had a good time, but was left wanting more. Here&amp;rsquo;s my thoughts.
Introduction Star wars Jedi: Fallen order came out in November 2019 and most certainly it has already been reviewed left and right (and has an overall score of 79 on metacritic at the time of writing). Given that I don’t play many different titles, let alone finish them, I thought I could attempt a review of my own.</description></item></channel></rss>
