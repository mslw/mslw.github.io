# Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order
Recently, I completed the latest Star Wars game. I had a good time, but was left wanting more. Given that I don’t play many games, let alone finish them, I thought I could try writing my own review.

## Intrtoduction

* comparison to Dark Souls (mb this and previous in intro)

## Plot & characters
The game is set five years after the events of Revenge of the Sith movie (Episode III). The player takes on the role of Cal, a Jedi padawan who managed to escape the Jedi purge and is now forced into hiding. This means that he owns a lightsaber and has certain prowess in using the Force from the very beginning of the game, but his repressed memories provide an explanation for some skills being unlocked throughout the story. Many of them are related to mobility, and are cleverly brought about by training flashbacks triggered at moments where they become essential to progress through a map. The aspect of having to accept the past to be able to move forward is nicely played out at one point of the story, in its later stages, but other than that I didn’t feel especially engaged emotionally with the protagonist.

Overall, the plot seemed fairly unremarkable, at times to the point of being cliche. You travel the galaxy, meet interesting people, and kill stormtroopers. Though you get to swing a lightsaber a lot, so maybe that’s all a Star Wars game really needs.

Actually, other characters didn’t seem very interesting either. The most important of them, Cere (Cal’s mentor) and the Second Sister (main villain) felt just OK, even though their backstories were supposed to be powerful (involving betrayal, torture, dark side, etc.). The side characters seemed bland, with the glaring exception of Prauf, Cal’s only friend throughout his period of hiding: a seasoned blue collar worker belonging to the Scrappers Guild, sincere and warm-hearted, with modest ambitions. He only appears in the prologue, but despite that, he was my favourite character - helped, probably, by the voice acting from [Wojciech Żołądkowicz (PL)](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wojciech_%C5%BBo%C5%82%C4%85dkowicz).  Also quite interesting (and with more screen time) was  Greez: an older, uncle-type pilot with beer belly and gambling addiction, referring to the protagonist in the tone of ‚one day, kid, I should teach you how to pilot a ship… not mine, of course’. His voice acting, by [Janusz Wituch (PL)](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janusz_Wituch) was pretty much on point, too. Speaking of which, the Polish dubbing was overall really good, ranging from OK to seriously great, and I was at no point tempted to search for an option to switch to original.

Going back to the plot being unremarkable, for me the low point came at Kashyyk, where serious effort leads to establishing contact with Wookie chieftain Tarfful… only for the protagonist to learn in a quick encounter that indeed, he needs to climb the humongous Origin Tree, and that indeed, to get to the top, one must start at the bottom. Only in a few dialogues does the player have to choose an option, but the choices never seem meaningful. Enough said, it is no Witcher game.

That being said, there are high points as well. The prologue, where the player learns character control by navigating a spaceship scrapyard (where Cal worked with Prauf), is a masterclass in climate, built through visuals and overheard conversations: to me it felt like a communist-era shipyard moved to cosmos. As mentioned above, Cal’s flashbacks take a serious turn as the story develop, and for a while become actual character development. And Cal’s vision at Bogano, leading to the final part of the game, is downright serious and creepy.

## Gameplay
* sword styles: single vs double (& overall form based on strong attacks)
* difficulty level
* pace picks up in last part
* jumping issues
