There are several ways of installing and managing python on macOS, and in this post I am taking a closer look at pyenv. The post is divided into two segments. In the first (which I called "life story" during writing) I explain why I was avoiding pyenv for a long time and what caused me to give in. The second is technical and aims to provide a short reference for creating and using my current setup.

There are, obviously, many blog posts about using pyenv. However, most of what I found didn't cover my use case entirely, so here is a compilation of things I wish I knew earlier.

## Part 1: what I used before

For a very long time I have been using [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) ("the missing package manager for macOS") to take care of my python installation. I also use homebrew to install many other programs, so `brew install python3` and, if needed `brew update python3` were nice, easy and natural.

Another key element was [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/) ("a tool to create isolated python environments"). Install python with homebrew, create per-project virtual environments with virtualenv, have a relatively useful set of packages in the global installation and be happy. No need for extensions, such as [virtualenvwrapper](https://pypi.org/project/virtualenvwrapper/).

## Part 2: the turning point

While homebrew-installed python is easy to update, it is perhaps a little bit too easy. Sometimes, I triggered an update when installing or updating some other program (formula). Additionally, default behaviour of homebrew is to perform cleanup, that is remove old versions of a program after installing a new one. This is desired in most cases (to avoid eating up disk space), but not always with python.

This is because virtualenv does not create a copy of python installation, instead relying on the existing one (at least by default, I should check what the `--copies` / `--always-copy` option does). As a result, upgrading python through homebrew breaks links to python used in a virtual environment. And if an older version of python is needed when building an environment, then it somehow needs to be installed in the first place.

So from time to time I had a bad day, because an update broke my python. In most cases, however, I could rebuild any environment (with the new version of python) simply by calling `virtualenv path/to/the/env` and running `pip install -r requirements.txt` inside. After all, there isn't that much difference between, say, 3.7 and 3.8.

However, some changes are game breaking. As of today, atlasreader does does not work on python above 3.7 (I think due to changes in packages on which it depends, but I didn't investigate). This is how I ended with python 3.9 and needing 3.7.

## Part 3: assumptions

The recommendations below will be most useful for people who, like me:
1. work on several (potentially drawn-out) projects simultaneously
2. rely on some standalone python programs, which may not always be quickly brought up to date
and for these reasons need both several versions of python and several sets of python packages (virtual environments) built for a given python version.

To this end, pyenv provides a unified, high-level interface for simple installation and swiapping out both python versions and specific virtual environments.

## The technicalities

### Installation - pyenv

Installation is straightforward using homebrew.

Prior to installing pyenv, I removed the homebrew-installed python (and a tangle of dependencies), which seems superfluous: the pyenv-installed python lives entirely separately from the homebrew-installed one.

Next, I installed pyenv-virtualenv.

### Installation - tying loose ends

Notes on making pyenv play nicely with homebrew (comment on how the separateness has its downsides).

### Installation - putting things onto pyenv


### Usage: jupyter

Pyenv or not, the right way for working with virtual environments is to install jupyter lab only once, under your primary python version, and then only install _kernels_ for each environment you want to use with jupyter:

* Activate virtualenv
* Install ipykernel package inside
* Register a kernel: `ipykernel install -user -name=<my_env_name>` (disp. name?)
* Deactivate

If no longer needed: `jupyter kernelspec uninstall`
