In my opinion, the first metal musician was Wagner, so Metallica recording with a symphony orchestra should make perfect sense, yet I was never very fond of the 99 edition. The new one, though, made a huge impression: I was listening to Spotify at work and had to take a short break to focus on the music.</description></item></channel></rss>
