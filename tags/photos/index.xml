FujiChrome Velvia and Astia from Fujifilm, or Kodachrome from Kodak became big names. As a kid discovering photography as a hobby, I may have only had Agfa Vista and Kodak Gold to choose from at the local photo lab, but I sure did read about the others.
Now that we are into the era of smartphone photography, and digital cameras are often associated with vlogging, I think Fujifilm does an outstanding job marketing-wise by advertising &amp;#34;film simulation modes&amp;#34;: color profiles that are applied directly by the camera to jpeg images.</description></item></channel></rss>
