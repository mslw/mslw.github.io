Still, preferences vary, and finding the right way to present a given result may feel almost like finding one&amp;#39;s own artistic voice.
For the last given example (widespread activation of multiple brain regions), I have grown to prefer a montage of slices, accompanied by a glass-brain showing selected cuts.</description></item><item><title>Working with Siemens physio (.puls) files</title><link>https://mslw.github.io/posts/2020-12-17-working-with-siemens-physio/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Dec 2020 16:25:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://mslw.github.io/posts/2020-12-17-working-with-siemens-physio/</guid><description>Siemens Physiological Monitoring Unit uses its own format for data storage. Conveniently, it produces text files with a fairly simple representation, which should be easy to parse. I only worked with pulse oximetry, but similar rules should hold for other physio data. This is a compilation of external sources, own experiences and code snippets.
Toolboxes Before we dig into the files: you may find what you already need in one of the following toolboxes (with which I have no experience), both in Matlab:</description></item></channel></rss>
