This was the second plant-based meat replacement I tried (after the Impossible Burger), but the first one I could get in Poland, which feels good. It was great.
Speaking of the patty, the outside look is the biggest giveaway. The taste is indeed very similar to meat, maybe seasoned in a slightly unusual way, but definitely believable. The texture is really great, not unlike coarsly ground beef.</description></item></channel></rss>
