I've been to the 2024 Berlin e-Prix, the (electric) Formula E event at Tempelhof, and it was a good time.

First of all, the cars are really cool, and seeing them in motion --- especially during the race, when they flew by in a group --- put a grin on my face.
They go proper fast. They sound better up close than they do on stream (the high pitch is not as noticeable).
A bit like a vacuum cleaner, but that's not a bad thing: quiet enough that there is no need for hearing protection, but loud enough to create a feeling that the speed comes from a mechanical process.

The racing is really close, as in nose-to-tail lap after lap.
I have seen it described as peleton racing, and that is exactly what it felt like, with positions being shuffled in hairpins every lap.[fn:1]
That shuffling is, unfortunately, mostly artificial, generated by attack mode regulations (increase of maximum power for a limiter period of time, activated by taking a designated slower line through a corner).
Drivers are forced to give up track position and gain it back, either by overtaking, or, more often, by waiting until others move to activate.
Activation is mandatory[fn:2], and the main strategy question is /when/ rather than /if/.
The skill and reflex required to make the most of the constantly flowing situation in tight traffic is unquestionable, but it is a particular kind of racing, and can feel slightly chaotic.

The attack mode itself, with its activation area highlighted in the video stream, has a gamification feeling to it.
So does, to some degree, the qualifying format (two groups, top four from each group moves to 1v1 duels in a one-lap shootout).
Interesting on paper, and not bad in practice, but the breaks between final stages deflate some of the excitement.

With a sprint race, there is no ability to move around the track and view things from different points.
The view I had from the tribunes was pretty average, with closeness to the track (awesome) offset by the field of view (not great).
I sat at the beginning of the main straight, on the outside of the final corner, in the second row.
Unfortunately, the corner is best taken wide, and in the closest parts the cars were half-hidden behind the concrete barrier, before emerging as they moved onto the straight proper.
That being said, live viewing is a full sensory experience, and an occasional /thunk/ would signal that somebody overcooked the exit, long before the video transmission would show a replay.
From my seat I could see part of the straight and one of the hairpins in the distance, but a large part of the circuit (the one closer to the airport terminal building) was behind the pit boxes, and therefore hidden.
Seeing that most tribunes were along the main straight, I don't think other seats were much better.
So overall it was not bad (the closeness really does make up for the limited view, and the screen view was perfectly fine to follow the action), but also a bit less than I expected from a compact circuit and an almost stadium-like setup within the airport.

Perhaps my biggest complaint would be the sound system.
I am in two minds about the music being played in the background of the commentary[fn:3], but I have a serious gripe with onboards.
Trackside audio must have used the same mix as the stream (plus the music?), and when played through the speakers, the onboard car sound was not just more high-pitched, but also louder than the actual cars passing by, to the point of being simply unpleasant.

As for the venue itself, having the race at the historic [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_Tempelhof_Airport][Tempelhof Airport]] is really very cool.
The old terminal provides a nice backdrop.
Accessibility by public transport (S-Bahn and U-Bahn) is a good thing, both in terms of reducing travel-related emissions and in terms of convinience to attend.

The event organisation in general was rather good.
Entry and exit were quick.
There were lots of food trucks to choose from.
Hydration stations, and plastic cups handed out at the entry were definitely nice (that being said, more hydration stations would be good as the queues before races were pretty long; given that the cups were not collected afterwards I am also not sure how much of an actual plastic saving it really was).
Available attractions were pretty much standard fare (simulators, reaction games etc.), but I never have a patience to queue for those.
One thing I regret not interacting with, and a really cool thing to feature by the organisers, were the stands of [[https://www.imeche.org/events/formula-student/][Formula Student]] teams.
On Saturday before qualifying there was enough time (and not much crowd yet) to have a chat, but in my defense I was still taking my time to fully wake up after an early S-bahn trip.

This brings us to the final major problem: not having any support races.
Formula E, and the Berlin e-Prix, was supposed to feature a single-make all-electric MINI Cooper race, which sounds like fun, but in the end [[https://us.motorsport.com/formula-e/news/nxt-gen-cup-explains-dropped-formula-e-support-plans/10598018/][the plan fell through]].
Having a short live concert with modern pop music instead was not a bad idea, and it gathered a reasonable crowd, but I'd definitely prefer more on-track action.
As it was, the long break between qualifying and race was best spent queuing for food or chugging beer --- I'm glad that I brought a friend along.

Overall, I am definitely happy to have seen Formula E live --- the cars are a joy to see in motion, and the entire event was nice, even though I wouldn't rank it as high as other motorsport events I've been to.

[fn:1] My previous, personal impression, having watched mostly race highlights, was that of bumper-car racing. This was definitely not the case here. I am glad to report that Berlin e-Prix was a non-contact sport, as it should be.
[fn:2] Formula E's [[https://www.fiaformulae.com/en/championship/rules-and-regulations][Rules and Regulations]] page seems intentionally ambiguous: "Drivers can choose to secure the extra speed if they want to race harder, giving them the edge to keep ahead of the competition or make moves up the pack", yet the 2023-2024 [[https://www.fia.com/regulation/category/109][sporting regulations]] are clear: "It is mandatory to use the total amount of time allocated for the Attack Mode" (section 37.3 b).
[fn:3] The commentary was in German and I'm pretty proud of myself that I could follow most of it when I paid attention.
