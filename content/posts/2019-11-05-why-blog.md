Why would I start a blog? List of reasons below.

* To check out [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). At first glance it seems nice and elegant.
* To have an outlet for occasional bursts of creativity. Sometimes I feel like writing. Sometimes writing helps me organise my thoughts.
* To practice writing. I read a sound advice on some scientist's blog (unfortunately can't find it now) that scientists should blog, because they need to write a lot, and for that there is no better practice than writing itself. I like this idea, given that blog format encourages longer, structured texts, compared to most social media. And I could use some practice.
* To keep some software-related notes for later reference. Some posts might get technical.
* Because I can do this with [github pages](https://pages.github.com/), so why not?
* I bought a new keyboard, which doubtlessly is an additional motivating factor.
